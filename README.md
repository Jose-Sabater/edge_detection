# Edge Detection Prestudy

## Description
In this project I aim to do a prestudy to investigate which edge detection algorithms suit best , finding sharp edges.
The original image that we will use to study the algorithms is the following:

## Results
Achieved the following results for detecting the edge. Would select canny as preferred method, due to its sharpness and simplicity to implement, as well as compute time.
